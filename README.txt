# To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have the required libraries (requests, pandas, logging, time, pickle, sklearn) installed.
2. At the top of the file, replace the url and api_key variables with the correct values for the data source you are using.
3. Run the code with Python. The retrieve_data function will be called and an API request will be made to retrieve cyber threat data.
4. The collected data will be saved to a file called cyber_threat_data.json in the same directory as the script.
5. The train_model function will be called and the model will be trained on the collected data.
6. The trained model will be saved to a file called model.pkl in the same directory as the script.
7. The detect_threats function will be called and the script will continuously collect data on network activity, flag potential threats, and log any threats it detects.
8. To stop the script, press Ctrl + C.
